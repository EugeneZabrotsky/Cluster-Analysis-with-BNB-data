# Cluster-Analysis-with-BNB-data
There shown a full process of feature engineering and cluster analysis. 

The dataset used here is a list of transactions with different features provided by "Belaruski Narodny Bank" at Datathon 2018. 
The task we had is the following:

Due to this solution and some of my pitch magic we won this Datathon.
